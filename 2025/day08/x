After making the ten shortest connections, there are 11 circuits: one circuit
which contains 5 junction boxes, one circuit which contains 4 junction boxes,
two circuits which contain 2 junction boxes each, and seven circuits
which each contain a single junction box. Multiplying together the sizes
of the three largest circuits (5, 4, and one of the circuits of size 2)
produces 40.
